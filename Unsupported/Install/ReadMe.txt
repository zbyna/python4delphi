DISTRIBUTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  You are free to distribute your applications built 
with Python for Delphi, but don't forget to install 
the python15.dll (or greater) in the windows\system 
folder of your client, or install the Python for 
windows distribution (it needs more space on the 
harddisk, but it's better because there are all 
Python modules and the help).
