Versions later than 1.8 contain support for remote debugging.  Read 
http://pyscripter.googlepages.com/remotepythonengines for details.  
Please note that to use remote debugging you need to download and 
install the Python package Rpyc version 2.6, available for download from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/rpyc. (highly recommended).

To install rpyc, unzip the downloaded file into the lib\site-packages 
subdirectory of the Python distribution. Repeat this for each version 
of Python you're interested in using.

Please visit http:\\pyscripter.googlepages.com for information about
remote debugging and other PyScripter related topics.
