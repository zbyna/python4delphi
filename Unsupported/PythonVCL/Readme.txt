  To do.txt                    A to do list.
  Components\Python.*          The "Python for Delphi" package for Delphi 3.
  Components\Sources\Vcl       The source folder of the experimental VCL use
                               inside Python.
  Lib                          Library of Python modules.
  PyDelphi                     A Python developpment environment
                               written in Delphi.
  VCL Generator                An application that generates Delphi and Python
                               source code in order to embed Delphi components into
                               Python. This is still experimental.

INSTALLATION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  For Delphi 3, install the "Python_d3" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\VCL\D3" to the Delphi path.

  For Delphi 4, install the "Python_d4" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\VCL\D4" to the Delphi path.

  For Delphi 5, install the "Python_d5" package located in the Components folder
  and add the folder "...\Components\Sources\VCL\D4" to the Delphi path.


NOTE:
~~~~~
  For the VCL project, look at the file ReadMe.txt in the "VCL generator" folder.


UPDATE:
~~~~~~~
  You'll find the latest version at http://www.multimania.com/marat

DISTRIBUTION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  You are free to distribute your applications built with Python for Delphi,
  but don't forget to install the python15.dll in the window\system folder of
  your client, or install the Python for windows distribution (it needs more
  space on the harddisk, but it's better because there are all Python modules
  and the help).
